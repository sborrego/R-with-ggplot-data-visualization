# R with ggplot2: Data Visualization  
University of South Florida - Fall Workshop  
Tuesday, January 13th, 2024  
9:00 am - 10:30 am EST

The goal for this workshop is to build on the fundamental R skills introduced in [previous workshops](https://github.com/sborrego/r-programming-an-introduction) and focus on data visualization. We will predominately use R packages from Tidyverse including the powerful and popular ggplot2. This is a hands-on workshop, please follow the installation and RStudio access instructions provided prior to the date of the workshop.

## Install R and RStudio or get access on Posit (Formerly RStudio Cloud)

To participate in this workshop you will need to have access to the programming language R and RStudio - see the options below. Please be prepared and have R and RStudio setup using either method before the workshop. If you are experience any trouble with installation, please contact me prior to the workshop **staceyborrego@gmail.com**.

If you are using RStudio on your own computer, I also recommend that you install the Tidyverse package ahead of time. You may run into errors and will need to update your version of R and/or RStudio. Please reach out if you run into any issues.

### Option 1 - **recommended**

Accessing Rstudio on the cloud is an excellent alternative to installing it on your own computer. You will need to sign up for a free account on their website by following the instructions below. If you already have an accout with the RStudio Cloud, your credentials will still work on the Posit website.

Website: [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/)  
- Click **Get Started** 
- Click **Sign Up**
- Provide the necessary information or log in if you have an account with RStudio Cloud
- Under *Your Workspace* on the left side, *Your Content* should be selected
- On the far right, under your name at the top, click on the blue **New Project** button, then **New RStudio Project**
- At the top you can *rename* the project by clicking on "Untitled Project"  

You are all set! This workspace will be saved and ready to access anytime in the future.

### Option 2

Another option is install all the software on your computer. You will need to install **BOTH** the R programming language and RStudio.
